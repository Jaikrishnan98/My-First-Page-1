<h1>My Favourite stories</h1>

<h2 class="apple">Apple&nbsp;story</h2>
<p>The little apple clung tightly to the branch as a gentle breeze blew by. An older apple, noticing the younger apple’s despair chuckled and said, “Looks like you're holding on to that branch for dear life little buddy.”</p>

<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-5 col-sm-12">
<h2 class="love">Love&nbsp;story</h2>
<p>Having just cemented a new bridge, my dental-assistant mother said to her patient, “Your girlfriend’s going to love your new teeth.” He replied, “I’m between girlfriends right now.” She said, “Don’t go anywhere. I have two daughters, Kathy and Vicky. Let me get their pictures from my wallet.” Dan was still reclined in the dental chair with his bib on and wasn’t going anywhere. Rushing back, she showed him her daughters’ photos, saying, “Here is our phone number. Give Kathy a call—she’s the older one.” He called, and we’ve been happily married for 39 years. Thanks, Mom!.</p></div>

<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-11 col-sm-12"><h2 class="bike">The&nbsp;Mini&nbsp;bike</h2><p>You are either completely in love with the Honda Z series or you have no idea what it is. For those in the latter category, here’s a quick intro (which will then be followed by a longer story about the origins of the bike). The Honda Z50 was a street-legal mini-bike whose popularity was a huge surprise to almost everyone. It had a 49cc engine, five-inch wheels, and the first US imports in 1968 looked like Honda was trying to bring Oompa Loompas to the Hell’s Angels. Or at least the beach branch.</p></div>
